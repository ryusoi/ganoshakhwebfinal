    about_title: 'About Us',
    about_text: "Gano Shakh is Iran's premier producer of log-grown Ganoderma lucidum. Unlike most commercial Reishi grown on grain substrates, we use natural hardwood logs. This traditional method, while more time-consuming, yields fruiting bodies with significantly higher concentrations of bioactive compounds, including triterpenoids and beta-glucans.\n\nOur facility combines ancient wisdom with modern quality control, ensuring that every mushroom we harvest is potent, pure, and effective.",
    cultivation_title: 'The Art of Cultivation',
    cultivation_log_title: 'Log Cultivation (The Gano Shakh Way)',
    cultivation_log_text: "We select specific hardwood logs, inoculate them with premium Ganoderma spawn, and bury them in nutrient-rich soil within controlled shade houses. It takes months for the mycelium to colonize the wood and for the fruiting body to emerge. This struggle against natural wood fibers forces the mushroom to produce potent defense compounds—the very compounds that support human health.\n\nResult: High density, high triterpenoid content, superior therapeutic value.",
    cultivation_container_title: 'Container / Bag Cultivation',
    cultivation_container_text: "Common in the industry, this method uses sawdust blocks in plastic bags. It is faster and cheaper, but often results in a product with lower density and sometimes residual grain starch.\n\nWe focus on log cultivation to avoid these compromises.",
    cultivation_outdoor_title: 'Outdoor & Environmental Control',
    cultivation_outdoor_text: "Our farm utilizes the natural climate of the region, supplemented by precise humidity and temperature controls. This semi-wild approach ensures the mushrooms develop resilience and full spectrum nutritional profiles.",
    farm_tour_title: 'Virtual Farm Tour',
    farm_tour_text: 'Take a look inside our greenhouses and see the Gano Shakh difference.',
    science_title: 'The Science of Ganoderma',
    science_text: "Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) has been studied for decades. Modern research has identified two main classes of bioactive molecules: Polysaccharides (Beta-Glucans) and Triterpenoids (Ganoderic Acids).\n\nThese compounds are responsible for the mushroom's immunomodulating, anti-inflammatory, and adaptogenic properties.",

    science_log_title: 'Key Advantages of Log-Cultivated Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi)',
    science_log_intro: 'Log-cultivated Reishi (especially Duanwood or natural wood log methods) is widely regarded as superior in quality to sawdust-substrate cultivation. Scientific studies and cultivation experts confirm higher levels of key medicinal compounds, particularly triterpenoids along with better antioxidant activity. These differences arise from longer growth times, natural nutrient uptake, and environmental factors that promote fuller bioactive development.',
    science_log_diff_title: 'Main Quality Differences',
    science_log_diff_1: 'Bioactive Potency — Log-grown Reishi shows ~1.2-fold higher total triterpenoids (e.g., lucidenic acids up to 2.19-fold higher) and stronger antioxidant effects (DPPH and FRAP assays).',
    science_log_diff_2: 'Growth Conditions — Natural hardwood logs mimic wild conditions, leading to a broader spectrum of compounds, while sawdust bags enable faster but less potent growth with potential fillers or contaminants.',
    science_log_diff_3: 'Traditional and Market Consensus — Premium "Duanwood" Reishi (log-grown on native oak logs) is the gold standard in Traditional Chinese Medicine and modern supplements, commanding higher prices due to measurable superiority in potency.',
    science_log_evidence_title: 'Summary of Evidence',
    science_log_evidence_text: 'A 2024 Frontiers in Nutrition study directly compared fruiting bodies → wood log cultivation outperformed sawdust-based methods in triterpenoid content and antioxidant activity, though polysaccharides were similar and protein slightly higher in sawdust-grown samples. Suppliers and experts emphasize that log-grown Reishi develops over 9–12 months in natural settings, absorbing diverse nutrients from hardwood and soil, resulting in more robust, authentic medicinal profiles.',
    science_log_comp_title: 'Comprehensive Comparison: Log Cultivation vs. Sawdust Substrate',
    science_log_comp_intro: 'Ganoderma lucidum, commonly known as Reishi or Lingzhi, is prized for its polysaccharides, triterpenoids (especially ganoderic and lucidenic acids), and other bioactive compounds. Cultivation method dramatically affects final quality. Sawdust methods prioritize speed (3–6 months) but sacrifice depth. Log methods take 9–24 months, resulting in dramatically higher potency, closer to wild-crafted Reishi.',

    myco_review_title: 'Mycelium Materials: A Resource-Rich Scientific Review — From Packaging to Habitats (Earth & Beyond)',
    myco_review_abstract_title: 'Abstract',
    myco_review_abstract_text: 'This review synthesises the current state (2020–2025) of mycelium-based materials (MBMs) across packaging, leather substitutes, textiles, footwear, bags, and construction — including NASA-funded work on mycelium habitats for space and terrestrial housing. It integrates primary industry players, peer-reviewed findings, prototype case studies, and techno-economic and environmental considerations to argue that mycelium is an emergent, scalable class of sustainable biomaterials with unique self-growing, compostable, insulating, and potentially radiation-attenuating properties. Key technological bottlenecks and research priorities are identified for moving from niche products to mainstream material systems.',
    myco_review_sec1_title: '1. Introduction & scope',
    myco_review_sec1_text: 'Fungal mycelium (the filamentous hyphal network) can be guided to colonise lignocellulosic substrates and, after controlled growth and post-processing, yield engineered composites with tunable mechanical, thermal, acoustic, and biodegradation properties. Over the past decade industry and academia have moved from proof-of-concept objects and art installations to industrial pilots for packaging, fine mycelium leather, footwear & accessories, and even structural elements and habitat prototypes. NASA and other agencies are exploring MBMs as in-situ construction materials for lunar and Martian habitats because of low mass, in-place growth potential, and putative radiation and thermal benefits. This review covers mechanistic materials science, processing pathways, representative companies & projects, environmental life-cycle claims, and future research directions.',
    myco_review_sec2_title: '2. Materials science fundamentals',
    myco_review_sec2_sub1_title: '2.1 Biology → material',
    myco_review_sec2_sub1_text: 'Organism & feedstock: Common strains used include Pleurotus, Ganoderma, Trametes, and engineered basidiomycetes; they colonise agricultural residues (hemp hurd, corn stover, sawdust) converting them into a cohesive myco-composite. Growth control (temperature, humidity, O₂, pH) and strain selection determine hyphal density and the resulting composite modulus, toughness, and porosity.\n\nStructure–property relationships: Mechanical strength arises from hyphal network density and the degree of cross-linking within chitin-rich cell walls; composite properties scale with substrate particle size, packing density, and growth time. Post-growth heat-treatment or chemical crosslinking increases stiffness and water resistance but reduces compostability. Peer-reviewed and conference reports quantify compressive strengths of mycelium bricks in ranges useful for lightweight load-bearing infill and insulation applications.',
    myco_review_sec2_sub2_title: '2.2 Processing routes (high level)',
    myco_review_sec2_sub2_text: 'Molded myco-composites: Mix substrate + spawn → pack into molds → incubate → thermal inactivation/drying → finish. Widely used for packaging and insulation.\n\nFine mycelium (engineered sheets): Controlled, layered growth to create continuous, leather-like sheets that can be tanned/finished for garments, upholstery, bags. Proprietary approaches (Fine Mycelium™, Mylo™) rely on strain and process engineering plus small polymer or fiber blends to reach desired tactile properties.\n\nLiving constructs / hybrid scaffolds: Weaving scaffolds (textile, 3D printed lattices) seeded with mycelium to form architected materials and potentially \'living\' building elements. Research prototypes exist; long-term stability, biofouling, and regulatory issues remain active areas of study.',
    myco_review_sec3_title: '3. Representative companies, projects & demonstrators',
    myco_review_sec3_text: '3.1 Packaging\nEcovative (Mushroom® Packaging / MycoComposite™): Industrially mature model for protective packaging and cooler/insulative products — commercial partnerships and scale-up efforts documented. Ecovative’s systems use hemp/wood waste and mycelium; products are home-compostable.\n\n3.2 Mycelium leather & fashion\nMycoWorks (Fine Mycelium™) and Bolt Threads (Mylo™): Both produce leather alternatives used by luxury brands; approaches differ (MycoWorks focuses on a more structured engineered mycelial matrix, Bolt Threads mixes mycelium with regenerated cellulose and a thin finishing layer). These companies are prototypes → limited commercial rollouts and brand collaborations have been publicised.\n\n3.3 Architecture / construction\nHy-Fi (The Living / MoMA PS1): Iconic example of molded mycelium bricks used architecturally; showed feasibility for temporary structures and inspired follow-up engineering studies.\n\nNASA Mycotecture & NIAC-funded projects: NASA Ames (NIAC) and associated researchers have been funded to study growing habitats from mycelium for lunar/Martian use — focusing on feedstock recycling, low-mass transport, radiation attenuation, and in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) concepts.\n\n3.4 Market & scale indicators\nMultiple market analyses (2024–2025) indicate rapid growth in the mycelium market (packaging and leather lead), with projections for multi-tens to hundreds of millions USD markets by the early 2030s, though numbers vary by source and depend on regulatory acceptance and scaling of consistent production lines.',
    myco_review_sec4_title: '4. Applications — technical assessment',
    myco_review_sec4_text: '4.1 Packaging (current commercial maturity: high)\nStrengths: Low embodied energy vs. foamed plastics, home compostability, custom molding, insulating properties.\nTechnical limits: Moisture sensitivity (unless coated), processing cycle times, and feedstock supply chain consistency. Life-cycle assessments show benefits when replacing polystyrene in protective packaging, provided end-of-life composting infrastructure exists.\n\n4.2 Leather substitutes, textiles, footwear, bags (maturity: pilot → early commercial)\nPerformance: Fine mycelium sheets approach leather in feel and tensile performance after finishing; abrasion and longevity metrics are improving but depend on finishing chemistry (often small % polymers added for durability).\nSustainability tradeoffs: Some leading products still use small synthetic finishes (PU coatings) which complicate full compostability claims; pure mycelium options exist but may require further durability improvements.\n\n4.3 Building materials & habitats (maturity: research → early prototype)\nAdvantages: Excellent thermal & acoustic insulation, low density, potential for local growth from organic waste streams, lower transport mass than conventional bricks/insulation. NASA’s rationale for space: deliver compact dormant inocula and grow structures in situ to reduce payload mass and exploit waste streams.\nConstraints: Mechanical strength and weatherproofing — unmodified mycelium composites are unsuitable for exterior load-bearing without protective shells, coatings, or hybridisation (e.g., combining with regolith or polymers). Standardisation, fire codes, and long-term degradation in real environments require extensive testing.',
    myco_review_sec5_title: '5. Environmental & life-cycle considerations',
    myco_review_sec5_text: 'Carbon & energy: Mycelium growth uses low-temperature biological energy; several LCA studies show lower cradle-to-gate impacts vs. petrochemical foams and animal leather, but results are sensitive to substrate sourcing, post-processing energy (drying, coatings), and transport logistics.\n\nEnd-of-life: Compostability is a major advantage — fully organic MBMs can return to soil. However, added finishing layers (PU, dyes) can hinder composting. Circularity benefits accrue if feedstock is agricultural waste and products are composted or used as soil amendments.',
    myco_review_sec6_title: '6. Technical challenges & research priorities',
    myco_review_sec6_text: 'Scale & cycle time reduction: Growth times and incubation footprint need optimisation (bioreactor design, vertical farming).\n\nStandardised property metrics: ASTM/ISO standard tests for mycelium composites (compressive/tensile, fire, moisture uptake) are needed to enable building code integration.\n\nDurability vs compostability tradeoffs: Develop bio-based finishes that impart weather, abrasion, and microbe resistance without introducing fossil polymers.\n\nGenetic/strain engineering: Strain selection and non-GMO process improvements to tailor hyphal chemistries (higher chitin, melanins for radiation shielding). Ethical/regulatory frameworks for engineered strains must be addressed.\n\nISRU integration & in-space validation: For off-planet habitats, validate regolith-mycelium composites, sterilisation and long-term stability under vacuum, thermal cycling, and ionising radiation. NASA-funded NIAC projects are already investigating these vectors.',
    myco_review_sec7_title: '7. Case study summaries (concise)',
    myco_review_sec7_text: 'Hy-Fi (2014): Demonstrated architectural-scale moulding and assembly of mycelium bricks for a temporary pavilion — showed feasibility but also highlighted weathering and lifetime issues.\n\nEcovative packaging (commercial): Replaced fossil-foam for protective packaging; matured manufacturing and commercial partnerships.\n\nMycoWorks / Bolt Threads (fashion): Multiple brand collaborations and limited releases of mycelium leather goods, showing market interest and technical feasibility for luxury items.\n\nNASA mycotecture (NIAC, 2024–2025): Funded research investigating habitat growth on lunar/Martian surfaces using fungi and mission waste streams; positions MBMs as candidate ISRU materials.',
    myco_review_sec8_title: '8. Socioeconomic impacts & adoption pathways',
    myco_review_sec8_text: 'Supply chains: MBMs could create local circular manufacturing hubs around agricultural waste streams, reducing transport emissions and creating rural bio-economies.\n\nRegulatory & market adoption: Building codes, fire safety standards, and consumer trust (stigma of "fungus") are non-technical barriers. Certification (OEKO-TEX, LWG, etc.) for fashion and standardised LCA disclosures will accelerate adoption.',
    myco_review_sec9_title: '9. The future: material evolution for Earth & humankind — reasoned projection',
    myco_review_sec9_text: 'Mycelium materials combine biological self-assembly, low embodied energy, and circular end-of-life — characteristics aligned with a decarbonising economy. Over the next decade, the likely pathway is: broad commercial adoption in packaging and specialty fashion (luxury & sustainable brands), followed by scaled insulation and non-structural building components in construction, and long-term research into structural composites and extraterrestrial habitat demos. NASA’s investment signals both scientific plausibility and an aspirational pathway to ISRU-led habitat manufacturing that could accelerate terrestrial scale-up through technology transfer. Responsible scale-up should prioritise green finishing chemistries, supply chain transparency, and standardised testing.',

Este método tradicional, aunque requiere más tiempo, produce cuerpos fructíferos con concentraciones significativamente más altas de compuestos bioactivos, incluyendo triterpenoides y beta-glucanos.\n\nNuestra instalación combina la sabiduría antigua con el control de calidad moderno, asegurando que cada hongo que cosechamos sea potente, puro y efectivo.",

    science_log_intro: 'El Reishi cultivado en troncos (especialmente métodos Duanwood o madera natural) es ampliamente considerado superior en calidad al cultivo en sustrato de aserrín. Estudios científicos y expertos confirman niveles más altos de compuestos medicinales clave, particularmente triterpenoides junto con una mejor actividad antioxidante. Estas diferencias surgen de tiempos de crecimiento más largos, absorción natural de nutrientes y factores ambientales.',

    myco_review_title: 'Materiales de Micelio: Una Revisión Científica Rica en Recursos — Del Embalaje a los Hábitats (Tierra y Más Allá)',
    myco_review_abstract_title: 'Resumen',
    myco_review_abstract_text: 'Esta revisión sintetiza el estado actual (2020–2025) de los materiales basados en micelio (MBM) en embalaje, sustitutos del cuero, textiles, calzado, bolsos y construcción, incluido el trabajo financiado por la NASA sobre hábitats de micelio para viviendas espaciales y terrestres. Integra a los principales actores de la industria, hallazgos revisados por pares, estudios de casos de prototipos y consideraciones tecnoeconómicas y ambientales para argumentar que el micelio es una clase emergente y escalable de biomateriales sostenibles con propiedades únicas de auto-crecimiento, compostables, aislantes y potencialmente atenuantes de radiación. Se identifican cuellos de botella tecnológicos clave y prioridades de investigación para pasar de productos de nicho a sistemas de materiales convencionales.',
    myco_review_sec1_title: '1. Introducción y alcance',
    myco_review_sec1_text: 'El micelio fúngico (la red de hifas filamentosas) puede guiarse para colonizar sustratos lignocelulósicos y, después de un crecimiento controlado y post-procesamiento, producir compuestos de ingeniería con propiedades mecánicas, térmicas, acústicas y de biodegradación ajustables. En la última década, la industria y la academia han pasado de objetos de prueba de concepto e instalaciones artísticas a pilotos industriales para embalaje, cuero fino de micelio, calzado y accesorios, e incluso elementos estructurales y prototipos de hábitats. La NASA y otras agencias están explorando MBMs como materiales de construcción in situ para hábitats lunares y marcianos debido a su baja masa, potencial de crecimiento in situ y supuestos beneficios de radiación y térmicos. Esta revisión cubre la ciencia de materiales mecanicista, vías de procesamiento, empresas y proyectos representativos, reclamos de ciclo de vida ambiental y direcciones de investigación futuras.',

    myco_review_sec2_sub1_text: 'Organism y materia prima: Las cepas comunes utilizadas incluyen Pleurotus, Ganoderma, Trametes y basidiomicetos modificados; colonizan residuos agrícolas (caña de cáñamo, rastrojo de maíz, aserrín) convirtiéndolos en un micocompuesto cohesivo. El control del crecimiento (temperatura, humedad, O₂, pH) y la selección de cepas determinan la densidad de hifas y el módulo, tenacidad y porosidad del compuesto resultante.\n\nRelaciones estructura-propiedad: La resistencia mecánica surge de la densidad de la red de hifas y el grado de reticulación dentro de las paredes celulares ricas en quitina; las propiedades compuestas escalan con el tamaño de partícula del sustrato, la densidad de empaquetamiento y el tiempo de crecimiento. El tratamiento térmico posterior al crecimiento o la reticulación química aumentan la rigidez y la resistencia al agua, pero reducen la compostabilidad. Los informes revisados por pares y de conferencias cuantifican las resistencias a la compresión de los ladrillos de micelio en rangos útiles para aplicaciones de relleno y aislamiento de carga ligera.',

    myco_review_sec2_sub2_text: 'Micocompuestos moldeados: Mezclar sustrato + semilla → empacar en moldes → incubar → inactivación térmica/secado → acabado. Ampliamente utilizado para embalaje y aislamiento.\n\nMicelio fino (hojas de ingeniería): Crecimiento controlado y en capas para crear hojas continuas similares al cuero que pueden curtirse/acabarse para prendas, tapicería, bolsos. Los enfoques patentados (Fine Mycelium™, Mylo™) se basan en la ingeniería de cepas y procesos más pequeñas mezclas de polímeros o fibras para alcanzar las propiedades táctiles deseadas.\n\nConstructos vivos / andamios híbridos: Tejer andamios (textiles, celosías impresas en 3D) sembrados con micelio para formar materiales arquitectónicos y elementos de construcción potencialmente \'vivos\'. Existen prototipos de investigación; la estabilidad a largo plazo, el biofouling y los problemas regulatorios siguen siendo áreas activas de estudio.',

Los sistemas de Ecovative utilizan residuos de cáñamo/madera y micelio; los productos son compostables en casa.\n\n3.2 Cuero de micelio y moda\nMycoWorks (Fine Mycelium™) y Bolt Threads (Mylo™): Ambos producen alternativas de cuero utilizadas por marcas de lujo; los enfoques difieren (MycoWorks se centra en una matriz micelial de ingeniería más estructurada, Bolt Threads mezcla micelio con celulosa regenerada y una capa de acabado delgada). Estas empresas son prototipos → lanzamientos comerciales limitados y colaboraciones de marca se han publicitado.\n\n3.3 Arquitectura / construcción\nHy-Fi (The Living / MoMA PS1): Ejemplo icónico de ladrillos de micelio moldeados utilizados arquitectónicamente; mostró viabilidad para estructuras temporales e inspiró estudios de ingeniería de seguimiento.\n\nProyectos financiados por NASA Mycotecture & NIAC: NASA Ames (NIAC) e investigadores asociados han sido financiados para estudiar el crecimiento de hábitats a partir de micelio para uso lunar/marciano, centrándose en el reciclaje de materia prima, transporte de baja masa, atenuación de radiación y conceptos de utilización de recursos in situ (ISRU).\n\n3.4 Indicadores de mercado y escala\nMúltiples análisis de mercado (2024–2025) indican un rápido crecimiento en el mercado de micelio (lideran embalaje y cuero), con proyecciones para mercados de decenas a cientos de millones de USD a principios de la década de 2030, aunque los números varían según la fuente y dependen de la aceptación regulatoria y la ampliación de líneas de producción consistentes.',
    myco_review_sec4_title: '4. Aplicaciones — evaluación técnica',
    myco_review_sec4_text: '4.1 Embalaje (madurez comercial actual: alta)\nFortalezas: Baja energía incorporada frente a plásticos espumados, compostabilidad doméstica, moldeo personalizado, propiedades aislantes.\nLímites técnicos: Sensibilidad a la humedad (a menos que esté recubierto), tiempos de ciclo de procesamiento y consistencia de la cadena de suministro de materia prima. Las evaluaciones del ciclo de vida muestran beneficios al reemplazar el poliestireno en embalaje protector, siempre que exista infraestructura de compostaje al final de la vida útil.\n\n4.2 Sustitutos de cuero, textiles, calzado, bolsos (madurez: piloto → comercial temprano)\nRendimiento: Las hojas de micelio fino se acercan al cuero en tacto y rendimiento de tracción después del acabado; las métricas de abrasión y longevidad están mejorando, pero dependen de la química de acabado (a menudo se agrega un pequeño % de polímeros para mayor durabilidad).\nCompromisos de sostenibilidad: Algunos productos líderes todavía usan pequeños acabados sintéticos (recubrimientos de PU) que complican las afirmaciones de compostabilidad total; existen opciones de micelio puro, pero pueden requerir mejoras adicionales en durabilidad.\n\n4.3 Materiales de construcción y hábitats (madurez: investigación → prototipo temprano)\nVentajas: Excelente aislamiento térmico y acústico, baja densidad, potencial de crecimiento local a partir de flujos de residuos orgánicos, menor masa de transporte que los ladrillos/aislamiento convencionales. Justificación de la NASA para el espacio: entregar inóculos latentes compactos y cultivar estructuras in situ para reducir la masa de carga útil y explotar flujos de residuos.\nRestricciones: Resistencia mecánica e impermeabilización — los compuestos de micelio no modificados no son adecuados para carga exterior sin carcasas protectoras, recubrimientos o hibridación (por ejemplo, combinación con regolito o polímeros). La estandarización, los códigos de incendios y la degradación a largo plazo en entornos reales requieren pruebas extensas.',
    myco_review_sec5_title: '5. Consideraciones ambientales y de ciclo de vida',
    myco_review_sec5_text: 'Carbono y energía: El crecimiento de micelio utiliza energía biológica de baja temperatura; varios estudios de LCA muestran impactos de la cuna a la puerta más bajos frente a espumas petroquímicas y cuero animal, pero los resultados son sensibles al abastecimiento de sustrato, energía de post-procesamiento (secado, recubrimientos) y logística de transporte.\n\nFin de vida útil: La compostabilidad es una ventaja importante — los MBM totalmente orgánicos pueden regresar al suelo. Sin embargo, las capas de acabado agregadas (PU, tintes) pueden dificultar el compostaje. Los beneficios de circularidad se acumulan si la materia prima es residuo agrícola y los productos se compostan o se utilizan como enmiendas del suelo.',
    myco_review_sec6_title: '6. Desafíos técnicos y prioridades de investigación',
    myco_review_sec6_text: 'Escala y reducción del tiempo de ciclo: Los tiempos de crecimiento y la huella de incubación necesitan optimización (diseño de biorreactores, agricultura vertical).\n\nMétricas de propiedad estandarizadas: Se necesitan pruebas estándar ASTM/ISO para compuestos de micelio (compresión/tracción, fuego, absorción de humedad) para permitir la integración del código de construcción.\n\nCompromisos de durabilidad frente a compostabilidad: Desarrollar acabados de base biológica que impartan resistencia a la intemperie, abrasión y microbios sin introducir polímeros fósiles.\n\nIngeniería genética/de cepas: Selección de cepas y mejoras de procesos no OGM para adaptar químicas de hifas (mayor quitina, melaninas para blindaje contra radiación). Deben abordarse los marcos éticos/regulatorios para cepas modificadas.\n\nIntegración de ISRU y validación en el espacio: Para hábitats fuera del planeta, validar compuestos de regolito-micelio, esterilización y estabilidad a largo plazo bajo vacío, ciclo térmico y radiación ionizante. Los proyectos NIAC financiados por la NASA ya están investigando estos vectores.',

Durante la próxima década, el camino probable es: adopción comercial amplia en embalaje y moda especializada (marcas de lujo y sostenibles), seguida de aislamiento escalado y componentes de construcción no estructurales en la construcción, e investigación a largo plazo en compuestos estructurales y demostraciones de hábitats extraterrestres. La inversión de la NASA señala tanto la plausibilidad científica como un camino aspiracional hacia la fabricación de hábitats liderada por ISRU que podría acelerar la ampliación terrestre a través de la transferencia de tecnología. La ampliación responsable debe priorizar químicas de acabado verdes, transparencia de la cadena de suministro y pruebas estandarizadas.',
